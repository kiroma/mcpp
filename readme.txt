        MINECRAFT C++ EDITION

=====================================

You'll need to copy a bunch of stuff into "Common/lib":
 - GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/), for modern OpenGL.
 - GLM (https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) for OpenGL mathematics.
 - SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for the cross-platform windows and other stuff.
 - STB (https://github.com/nothings/stb) for data loading and encoding.

By reading CMakeLists.txt of each project here, you should be able to
figure out by yourself how and where exactly to place the libraries.
